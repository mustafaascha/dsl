Gain an accelerated introduction to domain-specific languages in R. This compact, in-depth book shows you how DSLs are programming languages specialized for a particular purpose, as opposed to general purpose programming languages, and that you can use a dynamic language such as R to embed new DSLs in your R programs. Along the way, you’ll learn to specify tasks you want to do in a precise way and achieve programming goals within a domain-specific context. 

Domain-Specific Languages in R includes examples of DSLs from simple matrix arithmetic optimisation to languages for data-structure pattern matching and dynamic programming algorithms. After reading and using this book, you’ll understand how to write DSLs in R and have skills you can extrapolate to other programming languages.

## What You'll Learn

* Program with domain-specific languages and implement your own using R
* Design the grammar of your own DSLs
* Use metaprogramming to give your DSLs runtime behaviour
* Parse and manipulate expressions 
* Evaluate expressions in non-standard context while associating different elements of your DSLs with different scopes, so-called "tidyeval"

## Who This Book Is For

Those with prior programming experience and some familiarity with R programming.
