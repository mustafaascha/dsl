# Parsing and manipulating expressions {#sec:parsing_and_manipulating_expressions}

A powerful feature of the R programming language is that it readily allows us to treat expressions in the language itself as data that we can examine and modify as part of a program—so-called “meta-programming”. From within a program we can take a piece of R code and computationally manipulate it before we evaluate it. We just need to get hold of the code *before* it is evaluated, but there are several ways to do that. The simplest is to “quote” expressions, which leaves them as unevaluated expressions.

## Quoting and evaluating

If you write an expression such as

```r
2 * x + y
```

R will immediately try to evaluate it. It will look for the variables `x` and `y` in the current scope, and if it finds them it will evaluate the expression, if it does not, it will report an error. By the time R has evaluated the expression we either have a value or an error and, if the former, the expression is essentially equivalent to the result of evaluating the expression (computation time notwithstanding). A literate expression as this one is not something we can get a hold on in a program—we either get an error or the value it evaluates to. If we want to get hold of the actual expression, we need to “quote” it. If we wrap the expression in a call to the function `quote`, then we prevent the evaluation of the expression and instead get a data structure that represents the un-evaluated expression.

```{r}
quote(2 * x + y)
```

The class of an expression is a “call.”

```{r}
expr <- quote(2 * x + y)
class(expr)
```

It is a call because infix operators are syntactic sugar for function calls and all function call expressions will have this time. For “call” objects we can get their components by indexing as we would a list. The first element will be the function name and the remaining elements the arguments to the function call. For binary operators, there will, of course, be two arguments.

For this expression, the function call is an addition. 

```{r}
expr[[1]]
expr[[2]]
expr[[3]]
```

It is an addition because multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so the expression is equivalent to

```r
(2 * x) + y
```

so the multination is nested deeper in the expression than the addition—the multiplication can be accessed as the first argument to the addition call, so the second element in the object:

```{r}
expr[[2]][[1]]
expr[[2]][[2]]
expr[[2]][[3]]
```

To evaluate a quoted expression, we can use the function `eval`. The expression

```r
eval(quote(2 * x + y))
```

is equivalent to writing the literate expression

```r
2 * x + y
```

The `eval` function provides more flexibility in how an expression is evaluated since we can modify the scope of the evaluation, something we return to in much more detail in [Chapter @sec:env_and_expr].

Combining quoted expressions and functions introduces a few complications, at least if we want to handle the quoting within a function call. We can, of course, always pass quoted expressions as parameters to a function

```{r}
f <- function(expr) expr[[1]]
f(quote(2 * x + y))
```

but if we want to provide the literate expression to the function it gets more complicated

```{r}
f(2 * x + y)
```

In the function `f`, when we return `expr[[1]]`, R will first attempt to evaluate the expression, but the expression depends on the variables `x` and `y` that are undefined. Even if we define `x` and `y`, we still do not get a “call” object that we can manipulate. We just get the result of evaluating the expression.

```{r}
x <- 2
y <- 3
f(2 * x + y)
```

Using `quote` inside the function doesn’t help us. If we write `quote(expr)` we get the expression `expr`—a single symbol—as a result, not the argument we give to `f`. 

```{r}
f <- function(expr) {
  expr <- quote(expr)
  expr[[1]]
}
f(2 * x + y)
```

To get the actual argument as a quoted expression, we need to use the function `substitute`.

```{r}
f <- function(expr) {
  expr <- substitute(expr)
  expr[[1]]
}
f(2 * x + y)
```

Two things come together to make this work. First, function arguments in R are lazily evaluated, so the `expr` argument is never evaluated if we do not use it in an expression. So, even though `x` and `y` are not defined, we do not get any errors as long as we do not evaluate the argument to `f`. Second, `substitute` does not evaluate its argument but return a quoted object where variables are replaced with the value they have in the current scope.[^substitute-global-scope] The argument to `substitute` does not have to be a single variable name. It can be any expression that will be considered quoted after which variable substitution is done, and the return value will be the modified quoted expression.

```{r}
f <- function(expr) {
  expr <- substitute(expr + expr)
  expr
}
f(2 * x + y)
```

Another complication appears if we attempt to evaluate a quoted expression inside a function. You might expect these two functions to be equivalent, since `eval(quote(expr))` should be the same as `expr` but they are *not* equivalent.

```{r}
f <- function(expr) {
  expr + expr
}
g <- function(expr) {
  x <- substitute(expr + expr)
  eval(x)
}
```

If we make sure that both `x` and `y` are defined, then the function `f` returns twin the value of the expression.

```{r}
x <- 2; y <- 3
f(2 * x + y)
```

Function `g`, on the other hand, raises an error because the type of `x` is incorrect.

```{r}
g(2 * x + y)
```

The `eval` function will, by default, evaluate an expression in the current scope, which inside a function in that function’s scope. Inside `g`, we have defined `x` to be the expression we get from the call to `substitute`, so it is *this* `x` that is seen by `eval`. If you want `eval` to evaluate an expression in another scope, you need to give it an environment as a second argument. If you want it to evaluate the expression in the scope where the function is *called*, rather than inside the function scope itself, then you can get that using the `parent.frame` function:

```{r}
g <- function(expr) {
  x <- substitute(expr + expr)
  eval(x, parent.frame())
}
g(2 * x + y)
```

We will discuss environments, scopes, and how expressions are evaluated in much more detail in [Chapter @sec:env_and_expr]. For the remainder of this chapter, we will focus on manipulating expressions and not evaluating them.


## Exploring expressions

An expression is a recursive data structure, and you can explore it as such. We can define expressions in a grammar like this:

```
EXPRESSION ::= CONSTANT
            |  NAME
            |  PAIRLIST
            |  CALL EXPRESSION_LIST
EXPRESSION_LIST 
           ::= EXPRESSION 
            |  EXPRESSION EXPRESSION_LIST
```

Of course, for expressions we do not have a grammar for constructing these as such—we use R code—but this is the type declaration for expressions. All expressions are one of the four, and when it is a call, there will be other expressions involved. We can explore expressions using recursive functions where the first three meta-variables, `CONSTANT`, `NAME`, and `PAIRLIST` are basic cases and the third, `CALL` is the recursive call.

Of the meta-variables, `CONSTANT` refers to any literal data such as numbers or strings, `NAME` to any variable name, `PAIRLIST` refers to formal arguments in function definitions—more on this below—and CALL to function calls. Function calls capture everything more complicated than the first three options since everything in R that does anything is considered a function call, including such statements as function definitions and control structures. As we saw above, calls are list-like and always have at least one element. The first element is the function that is being called and the remaining elements the arguments to that function.

To recursively explore an expression we can write functions that test the four cases. Constants are recognised by the `is.atomic` function, names by the `is.name` function, pair lists by the `is.pairlist` and calls by the `is.call` function. A function for printing out an expression’s structure can look like this:

```{r}
print_expression <- function(expr, indent = "") {
  if (is.atomic(expr)) {
    if (inherits(expr, "srcref")) {
      expr <- paste0("srcref = ", expr)
    }
    cat(indent, " - ", expr, "\\n")
    
  } else if (is.name(expr)) {
    if (expr == "") {
      expr <- "MISSING"
    }
    cat(indent, " - ", expr, "\\n")
    
  } else if (is.pairlist(expr)) {
    cat(indent, " - ", "[\\n")
    new_indent <- paste0(indent, "       ")
    vars <- names(expr)
    for (i in seq_along(expr)) {
      cat(indent, "    ", vars[i], " ->\\n")
      print_expression((expr[[i]]), new_indent)
    }
    cat(indent, "    ]\\n")
    
  } else {
    print_expression((expr[[1]]), indent)
    new_indent <- paste0("  ", indent)
    for (i in 2:length(expr)) {
      print_expression(expr[[i]], new_indent)
    }
  }
}
```

Here, we do not explicitly test for the type of calls—if the expression is not one of the first three cases it must be the fourth. There are two special cases we handle in this printing expression—source references for function definitions and missing expressions in pair lists. We discuss these below.

We can see the function in action by calling it on the expression we explored above:

```{r}
print_expression(quote(2 * x + y))
```

The pretty-printed expression shows the structure we explored explicitly in the last section.

Declaring a function is considered a function call—a call to the function `function`:

```{r}
print_expression(quote(function(x) x))
```

For a function definition, we have a call object where the first argument is `function`, the second argument is the pair list that defines the function parameters, and the third element is the function body—another expression.  There is also a fourth element, however, called “srcdef”. This element is an atomic vector that captures the actual code used to define the function. In the printing function, we just print the text representation of the source definition, which we get by pasting the expression.

The argument list of a function we declare is where the pair list data structure is used—and only here. We can get the names of the formal parameters using the `names` function and the default arguments by indexing into the pair list. Parameters without default arguments are a special case here—the expression they contain is an empty string. In the printing function, we make this explicit by changing the empty string to the string `MISSING`. If we have default arguments, then those are represented as expressions we can explore recursively.

```{r}
print_expression(quote(function(x = 2 * 2 + 4) x))
print_expression(quote(function(x, y = 2 * x) x + y))
```

The usual case for function calls is that the first element in the “call” list is a symbol that refers to a function, but any expression that returns a function can be used as a function in R, so the first element of calls can be any expression. For example, if we define a function and call it right after, the first element of the call object will be the function definition.

```{r}
expr <- quote((function(x) x)(2))
print_expression(expr)
expr[[1]]
expr[[2]]
```

As an example of doing something non-trivial with expressions, we can write a function that collects all unbound variables in an expression. If we recurse through an expression, we can collect all the symbols—bound or unbound. To only get the unbound variables, we can keep track of those that are bound and not collect those. Ignoring, at first, those variables that might be bound outside of the expression itself—in the scope where we will call the function—the variables that are bound are those that are named in a function definition. Those, we can recognise as part of the pair list that is the second argument to calls to `function`. When recursing over expressions, we capture those and pass them on down the recursion. Otherwise, we simply collect the symbols. In the implementation below I use the linked lists, we have seen earlier to collect the symbols, and I translate the symbols into characters when I collect them. I do this because I can use the character representation of symbols to check if a symbol exists in an environment later on.

```{r}
collect_symbols_rec <- function(expr, lst, bound) {
  if (is.symbol(expr) && expr != "") {
    if (as.character(expr) %in% bound) lst
    else cons(as.character(expr), lst)
    
  } else if (is.pairlist(expr)) {
    for (i in seq_along(expr)) {
      lst <- collect_symbols_rec(expr[[i]], lst, bound)
    }
    lst
    
  } else if (is.call(expr)) {
    if (expr[[1]] == as.symbol("function"))
      bound <- c(names(expr[[2]]), bound)
    
    for (i in 1:length(expr)) {
      lst <- collect_symbols_rec(expr[[i]], lst, bound)
    }
    lst
    
  } else {
    lst
  }
}
```

When we collect symbols, we explicitly avoid the empty symbol. The empty symbol is the symbol we get when we recurse on a pair list for a function parameter without a default value, and we do not consider this a variable, bound or otherwise. Other than that, the way we handle symbols is straightforward. For pair lists, we collect the parameters that will be bound and recurse through the default arguments to collect any unbound variables there, and for calls, we handle the function definitions by extending the list of bound variables and then recursing. For anything else—which in practice mean for any atomic value—we just return the list we called the function with. There are no unbound variables in constant values.

The recursive function works on a quoted expression and collects all symbols that are not bound within the expression itself. We wrap it in a function that does the quoting of the expression, call the recursive function, and then remove the symbols that are defined in the calling scope (the `parent.frame`).

```{r}
collect_symbols <- function(expr) {
  expr <- substitute(expr)
  bound <- c()
  lst <- collect_symbols_rec(expr, NULL, bound)
  lst %>% lst_to_list %>% unique %>% 
          purrr::discard(exists, parent.frame()) %>%
          unlist
}
```

Here, I use the `discard` function from the `purrr` package to remove all elements that satisfy a predicate, and for the predicate, I use the function `exists` with a second argument that is the calling environment, `parent.frame`. This gets rid of symbols that are defined in the scope where we call `collect_symbols`, including globally defined functions such as `*`, `+` and `function`. We *could* collect all defined variables and pass them along in the `bound` variable, but collecting all symbols is more work than removing symbols afterwards with the combination of `discard` and `exists`.

I pipe the final result through `unlist` to translate the `list` into a character vector. This is only for pretty printing reasons. It gives nicer output to show in the book—for programming you can work with `list`s as easily as vectors.

If we get rid of variables `x` and `y` that we have defined above, the expression `2 * x + y + z` should have three unbound variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, and indeed that is what we find:

```{r}
rm(x) ; rm(y)
collect_symbols(2 * x + y + z)
```

If we define one of the variables, for example, `z`, then that is no longer unbound.

```{r}
z <- 3
collect_symbols(2 * x + y + z)
```

Function definitions also bind variables, so those are not collected:

```{r}
collect_symbols(function(x) 2 * x + y + z)
collect_symbols(function(x) function(y) f(2 * x + y))
```

Default values can contain unbound variables, and those we collect:

```{r}
collect_symbols(function(x, y = 2 * w) 2 * x + y)
```

We are not entirely done learning about how to explore expressions, though. Or rather, we are not done with learning how to use *non-standard evaluation*, which is what we are implementing in `collect_symbols`—the actual recursive exploration of expressions is as simple as what we have just seen. A function such as `collect_symbols` is a function we could imagine using to write more complicated functionality for a domain-specific language, but calling functions that do their own quoting and that evaluate expressions in scopes that depend on the call-stack introduces some complications.

If we write a simple function such as this:

```{r}
f <- function(expr) collect_symbols(expr)
```

we might expect it to give us the unbound variables in an expression, but it returns an empty list:

```{r}
f(2 + y * w)
```

The reason for this is the combination of the two issues we will have when we try to program with functions that do so-called "non-standard evaluation." First, when we use `substitute` in the `collect_symbols` function, we get the literal expression the function was called with. When we call the function from `f`, this is `expr`. The expression that `f` itself is called with does not get passed along. Second, the environment in which we test for a bound variable inside `collect_symbols` is the calling environment. When we call the function from `f` the calling environment is the body of `f`. In this environment, the variable `expo` is defined—it is the formal argument of the function—so it will be considered bound.

We will explore environments and how to program with non-standard evaluation in some detail later, but the general solution to these problems is to avoid using non-standard evaluation in functions you plan to call from other functions. It is a very powerful technique for writing a domain-specific language, but keep it to the interface of the language and not the internal functions you use to implement the language. For `collect_symbols` we can get around the problem by writing another function that takes as arguments an already quoted expression and the environment we should look for variables in. We can then call this function from `collect_symbols` when we want a non-standard evaluation and call the other function directly if we want to use it from other functions.

```{r}
collect_symbols_ <- function(expr, env) {
  bound <- c()
  lst <- collect_symbols_rec(expr, NULL, bound)
  lst %>% lst_to_list %>% unique %>% 
    purrr::discard(exists, env) %>%
    unlist
}
collect_symbols <- function(expr) {
  collect_symbols_(substitute(expr), parent.frame())
}
```

## Manipulating expressions

We can do more than simply inspect expressions. We can also modify them or create new ones from within programs. You cannot modify the two primitive expressions, constants and symbols. They are simply data, and there isn’t anything to modify. We can, however, modify calls and pair-lists, although the second is not something we would usually do—we work with pair lists when we create new functions, and it is easier to explicitly create a new function than it is to modify the definition of one. Either way, both pair lists and calls can be assigned to by indexing into their components.

To get it out of the way with, we can see an example where we modify a pair list. We can construct the expression for defining a function like this:

```{r}
f <- quote(function(x) 2 * x)
f
```

This is an expression of the type “call”—it is a call to the function `function` that defines functions (try saying that fast)—and its second argument is the pair list that defines its arguments.

```{r}
f[[2]]
```

If we assign to the elements in this pair list, we provide default arguments to the function. The values we assign must be quoted expressions:

```{r}
f[[2]][[1]] <- quote(2 * y)
f
```

To change the names of function arguments we must change the names of the pair list components which we do using the `names<-` function:

```{r}
names(f[[2]]) <- c("a")
f[[3]] <- quote(2 * a)
f
```

In this example, we also saw how we could modify the function body through its third component.

Through this example, we have already seen all we need to know about how to modify call expressions. What we were modifying was just a particular case of a call—the call to `function`. Any other call can be changed the same way.

```{r}
expr <- quote(2 * x + y)
expr
expr[[1]] <- as.symbol("/")
expr
expr[[2]][[1]] <- as.symbol("+")
expr
```

We can construct new call objects using the `call` function. As its first argument, this function takes the function to call—this can be a symbol or a string and will automatically be quoted. After that, you can give it a variable number of arguments that will be evaluated before they are put into the constructed expression. 

```{r}
call("+", quote(2 * x), quote(y))
call("+", call("*", 2, quote(x)), quote(y))
```

If you are creating a call to a function with named arguments, rather than an operator, you can provide those to the `call` function as well:

```{r}
call("f", a = quote(2 * x), b = quote(y))
```

It is essential that you quote the arguments if you do not want them evaluated. The `call` function will not do it for you.

```{r}
z <- 2
call("+", 2 * z, quote(y))
```

In the `rlang` package you have two additional functions for creating calls. The function `lang` works as the `call` function except that you can specify a namespace in which the called function should be found—not something we will use in this book. The `new_language` function lets you provide the call arguments as an explicit pair list—again something we will not explore further in this book.

```{r}
library(rlang)
lang("+", quote(2 * x), quote(y))
new_language(as.symbol("+"), pairlist(quote(2 * x), quote(y)))
```

The `rlang` package is worth exploring if you plan to do much meta-programming in R. It provides several functions for manipulating and creating expressions and functions, and functions for managing environments. We will explore the package more in [Chapter @sec:tidy-eval].

If the call you are making is to `function`, there is one extra complication. This function needs a pair list as its second argument, so you will have to make such a list. If you want to create a function without default parameters, you need to make a list with “missing” elements at named positions. The way to make a missing argument is by calling `substitute` without arguments, so a function that creates a list of function parameters without default arguments can look like this:

```{r}
make_args_list <- function(args) {
  res <- replicate(length(args), substitute())
  names(res) <- args
  as.pairlist(res)
}
```

and we can use it to construct a call to `function` like this:

```{r}
f <- call("function", 
          make_args_list(c("x", "y")), 
          quote(2 * x + y))
f
```

Remember, however, that this is an expression for creating a function, it is not the function itself, and it does not behave like a function.

```{r}
f(2, 3)
```

The error message here looks a bit odd. R is not complaining that `f` is not a function but that the function `f` cannot be found. This is because R will look for functions when you use a symbol for a function call and will not confuse the value `f` with the function `f`, and here we only have a value. To get the actual function, we need to evaluate the call.

```{r}
f <- eval(f)
f
f(2, 3)
```

A more direct way of creating a function is using the `new_function` function from the `rlang` package:

```{r}
f <- new_function(make_args_list(c("x", "y")), 
                  quote(2 * x + y))
f
f(2, 3)
```

As a final example, we can try to combine the expression creating methods we have just seen with the expression exploration functions from the previous section to translate expressions with unbound variables into functions. We can collect all unbound variables in an expression using the `collect_symbols_` function from earlier and then use `new_function` to create the function:

```{r}
expr_to_function <- function(expr) {
  expr <- substitute(expr)
  unbound <- collect_symbols_(expr, caller_env())
  new_function(make_args_list(unbound), expr, caller_env())
}
```

Here, I have used another function from `rlang`, `caller_env`. This function does the same as the `parent.frame` function we have used earlier, but has a more informative name, so if we have loaded `rlang` anyway, I prefer to use it over `parent.frame`.

In this call to `new_function`, we provide three arguments; before we only provided two. The arguments we provided earlier were the list of formal arguments and the expression that should be the body of the function—those we provide again here. The third argument is the enclosing environment of the function; where the function will find the value of variables that are not bound within the function itself as parameters or local variables. Since we consider variables found in the caller environment as bound, we have to make sure that the function we create can also find them, so we put the function in the same environment. If this seems mysterious to you, return to this example after you have read [Chapter @sec:env_and_expr] where we go into environments in much more detail.

The `expr_to_function` does exactly what we intended it to; it creates a function from an expression, whose arguments are the unbound variables in the expression.

```{r}
f <- expr_to_function(2 * x + y)
f
f(x = 2, y = 3)
g <- expr_to_function(function(x) 2 * x + y)
g
g(y = 3)(x = 2)
```

Since the order that the variables in the function will depend on the order in which they appear in the expression, and whatever order the `unique` function will leave them in, calling the resulting function is probably best done with named arguments…



[^substitute-global-scope]: The `substitute` function will replace variables by the value they contain in the current scope or the value they have in an environment you provide as a second argument, *except* for variables in the global environment. Those variables are left alone. If you experiment with `substitute`, be aware that it behaves differently inside the scope of a function from how it behaves in the global scope.
